    "desc": "Developed a comprehensive NLP pipeline for processing scanned environmental PDFs at the Government of British Columbia. Implemented document classification using regex patterns and BERT models, built duplicate detection with ROUGE and RapidFuzz algorithms, and integrated local LLM fallbacks with Ollama for robust processing capabilities. The system demonstrates strong performance in text metadata extraction, reliably detects potential duplicates, and makes conservative but highly accurate positive releasability predictions.",

On limited hardware, abstract-only LLaMA2 provided the best overall balance of relevance and readability, while RAG improved factual grounding. The pipeline includes an evaluation harness for ROUGE, BLEU, BERTScore, FKGL, CLI, DCRS, and SummaC.",

The agent uses LangDetect for language ID, UBC NLP Toucan for translation, and IBM Granite for classification and rewriting. It returns rationales, structured outputs, and handles errors across modular stages with reproducible runs.",
